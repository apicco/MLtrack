Machine learning algorithms and automation tools for classification of large trajectory datasets

# Examples

There are two steps in the automation process. First, the trajectories are automatically selected. This step is detailed in the *AUTOMATED_SELECTION* folder. The output trajectories need to be verified manually. This procedure is detailed in the *MANUAL_VALIDATION* folder.

## AUTOMATED SELECTION

bla bla

## MANUAL VALIDATION

In `setup.py` define the path to the trajectories that need to be validate. In this example, the trajectories are the output of the automated selection and are under `AUTOMATED_SELECTION/SELECTED_TRAJECTORIES`. 

The software needs also to know what is the original movie to overlay each trajectory to its patch for the validation.
